## Features

- **User Input**: Users can input various property features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, age of the property, and location rating.
- **Prediction Models**: The application uses advanced machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost and a Neural Network) to provide accurate price predictions.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Instant predictions based on user inputs with a seamless interface.
- **Data Processing**: Utilizes polynomial feature expansion and standard scaling for improved model accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask for managing requests and serving the application.
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn for preprocessing and model deployment.
- **Model Training**: XGBoost and Keras for creating and training the prediction models.
- **Data Handling**: Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Serialization**: Joblib for saving and loading trained models and scalers.
